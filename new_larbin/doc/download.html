<h2>Latest version</h2>

Here is the latest version of larbin :
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/larbin/larbin-2.6.3.tar.gz">
larbin.tar.gz</a>

<p>If you need another version of larbin, see <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42562">
here </a>.

<h2>Changelog</h2>

V2.6.3 (2003-07-09) :
<ul>
<li> Add the possibility to follow only internal links (ie on the same
site). See option noExternalLinks in larbin.conf.
<li> Correct a compilation problem with gcc 3.XX (and avoid warnings).
<li> Add the possibility to use "" in larbin.conf to define a token
containing blank char.
</ul>

V2.6.2 (2002-04-14) :
<ul>
<li> A very basic implementation of cookies has been added (see
COOKIES in options.h).
<li> Can now get images (see IMAGES and ANYTYPE in options.h).
<li> Rewrite the robots.txt and html parser (should use less ressources and
understand tags better).
<li> Try to be more portable (index becomes strchr, Makefile
update...). larbin should now compile on Solaris.
<li> Try to rewrite things in order to make some #ifdef more readable.
<li> Many cleanups and efficiency update thanks to profiling.
</ul>

V2.6.1 (2002-03-09) :
<ul>
<li> Some configurations did not compile.
<li> Possibility to get images with pages (follow img src).
<li> Correct fatal bug in proxy management.
<li> Improve robots.txt parser (normalize path : /./, %xx, ...).
<li> Cleanups.
</ul>

V2.6.0 (2002-01-12) : This version does not work with proxy
<ul>
<li> larbin website moves to sourceforge.
<li> Add a new output file, which does some stats on the size of the
pages (see STATS_OUTPUT in options.h).
<li> Depth can be calculated for each site or for the whole seach (see
DEPTHBYSITE in options.h).
<li> big work on the sequencer.
<li> dns requests follow CNAME chains (much less dns errors).
<li> More static buffers for avoiding allocations/fragmantations.
</ul>

V2.5.9 (2001-12-12) :
<ul>
<li> specificSearch has changed a lot and must now be configured from
"options.h" (instead of "larbin.conf").
<li> Try to make output interface simpler. The file to change is now
useroutput.cc. There are predefined examples
(interf/XXXuseroutput.cc).
<li> Try to make buffers for specfic pages more flexibles (see
"fetch/specbuf.cc" and "fetch/specbuf.h"). Add a dynamic buffers option.
<li> Can choose if you're interested by cgi (see CGILEVEL in
options.h).
<li> New management of timeout.
<li> Crawl through a proxy works again.
<li> Try to avoid too many dns calls and to increase the number of
sites simultaneously in ram.
<li> Improve the webserver.
<li> Possibility to totally disable the webserver (using port 0 in
larbin.conf). This way, it becomes possible to launch no thread at
all.
<li> correct small bug and enhance robots.txt parsing
</ul>

V2.5.0 (2001-11-22) :
<ul>
<li> The old config.h is now named options.h.
<li> The stats page now includes fancy histograms (thanks to Laurent
Viennot). see GRAPH in options.h (set by default).
<li> Possibility to limit bandwidth usage (see MAXBANDWIDTH in options.h).
<li> Larbin now works on freeBSD (a configure script has been added).
<li> Change in the RELOAD semantics. By default, it restarts from
where it last stops. To restart from scratch, use -scratch. Also save
duplicate information if they exists.
<li> Possibility to manage specific files with a bigger size than
maxFileSize (they are directly stored on disk). This is SPECIFICSAVE
in options.h.
<li> Possibility for larbin to stop when everything has been fetched
(EXIT_AT_END in options.h).
<li> Many code cleanups.
</ul>

V2.2.2 (2001-10-02) :
<ul>
<li> You can now save files and respect directory structure (option
MIRROR_SITES in config.h).
<li> Change the way depthInSite works (more intuitive).
<li> Correct bug with sites closing connection before the end of headers.
</ul>

V2.2.1 (2001-09-13) : This version is buggy if you try to read the
content of the pages (for instance if you use the SAVE option).
<ul>
<li> Add the possibility to suppress duplicate pages (option NO_DUP in
config.h).
<li> Parse the whole page (except headers), only when totally
received. This is much better for the duplicate option.
</ul>

V2.2.0 (2001-07-23) :
<ul>
<li> Add the possibility to save fetched pages in files.
<li> Replace select by poll for using unlimited number of file connexions.
<li> Some efficiency updates (url normalizer, html parser...).
<li> Possibility to query a same server many times simultaneously (use
with care if the server is not yours).
</ul>

V2.1.1 (2001-06-19) :
<ul>
<li> Url parser improvement.
<li> Possibility to use one less thread (if the output never does
blocking operation).
<li> Possibility to disable the -reload option : this avoids unnecessary
saves of the hashtable on disk (<tt>#define RELOAD</tt> in config.h).
</ul>

V2.1.0 (2001-06-06) : Should be quite more stable than the previous
ones : a quick test without tuning (but 24 hours long) gives back 4.5
million pages without any problem (memory consumption : 50 Mo).
<ul>
<li> Improve the html parser (do not parse comments and improve cgi
filter).
<li> Possibility to associate tags to urls.
<li> Update in the input system.
<li> Rewrite Makefiles and the configuration system (now much more
customizable).
<li> Again less allocations in many places thanks to static buffers
(especially url.cc and PersistentFifo.cc).
<li> Delete stupid (and buggy) hacks.
</ul>

V2.0.1 (2001-05-23) : Contains some bugs that may causes long term
slow down.
<ul>
<li> Rewrite of the input section (first step toward multi-host larbin).
<li> Rewrite of the the robots.txt parser (less allocation and fix a
very old bug).
<li> Small improvements of the html parser.
</ul>

V2.0.0 (2001-05-11) : Contains some bugs that may causes long term
slow down.
<ul>
<li>Big internal rewrite (it allows less dns calls and no more rapid
fire with virtual hosts).
<li>Much less copy of data.  
<li>Much less allocations : this should lead to less fragmentation, so
less memory consumption.
<li>Small API change (headers and content of the page are now char* :
before it was a String).
<li>More tolerant to buggy html.
</ul>

V1.2.2 (2001-04-04) :
<ul>
<li>More tolerant to buggy html
<li>Correct a bug with specificSearch (parsing of the configuration
file)
<li>Suppress some system calls when possible (especially time)
<li>Use less cpu when reaching the end of the search
<li>Stats improvements
<li>new Makefiles options (make stats and make bigstats), if you want
stats on stdout. "make bigstats" might decrease performances a lot.
</ul>

V1.2.1 (2001-03-12) :
<ul>
<li>More Makefile enhancement
<li>Suppress shutdown calls since they seem to hang some kernels
<li>Manage redirections as errors and follow them correctly
<li>Correct a bug with specificSearch (assertion failed)
<li>Output functions simplification
</ul>

V1.2.0 (2001-02-18) :
<ul>
<li>Use less threads (only for user interaction)
<li>Makefile enhancement (make all debug nodebug crash and prof)
<li>Change the directory structure
<li>Correct a bug in robots.txt management
<li>Correct a bug in frame management
</ul>

<li>Minor bug fixes and feature enhancements
</ul>

V1.1.3 :
<ul>
<li>adns 1.0
<li>Little performance improvements (especially in the parser)
</ul>

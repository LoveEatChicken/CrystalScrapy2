Running :

Be sure you did the configuration

./larbin

*********************
Supported platforms :

Larbin has mainly been developped under Linux
I've tested larbin with success on Linux and freeBSD.

It probably won't compile right out of the box on any other platform,
but i'll work on it for future versions. Please report success or
failure on any platform.
